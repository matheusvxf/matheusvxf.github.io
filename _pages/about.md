My primary research interest are in Algorithm Design, Game Theory, Cryptography and Security. My main research goal is to design secure and fair systems under strategic behavior. I am currently a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate in the [Theory of Computer Science](http://theory.cs.princeton.edu/) group at Princeton University and I will be joining Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Fall 2021. During my Ph.D., I was fortunate to be advised by [S. Matthew Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/).

Previously, I did my undergraduate studies at [Federal University of Itajub√°](https://en.unifei.edu.br/) in Brazil. During my Undergraduate, I also spent a great year as an exchange student at [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) under a [BSMP](https://www.iie.org/programs/brazil-scientific-mobility) scholarship.
