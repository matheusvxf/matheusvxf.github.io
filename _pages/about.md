With research interests in Algorithm Design, Game Theory, Cryptography and Security, my main goal is to design secure and fair systems under strategic behavior.  I'm currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard John A. Paulson School Of Engineering And Applied Sciences. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Princeton University under the guidance of [S. Matthew Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/).

Previously, I obtained with honors a B.S. in Computer Engineering e my undergraduate studies at [Federal University of Itajub√°](https://en.unifei.edu.br/), Brazil. During my Undergraduate, I also spent a great year as an exchange student at [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) under a [BSMP](https://www.iie.org/programs/brazil-scientific-mobility) fellowship.
