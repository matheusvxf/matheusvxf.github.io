I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Princeton University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Matt Weinberg. Previously, I did my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at Federal University of Itajub√°, Itabira and I spent one year as visiting student at University of California, San Diego.

I am primarily interested in Algorithm Design. My current research interests include Algorithmic Game Theory, Mechanism Design and its applications to Computer Security and Cryptography.
