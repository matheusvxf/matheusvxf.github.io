I am a Computer Science PhD student in the [Theory of Computer Science](http://theory.cs.princeton.edu/) group at Princeton. I am fortunate to be advised by [S. Matthew Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/).

Previously, I did my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering (2016) at [Federal University of Itajub√°](https://en.unifei.edu.br/), Itabira and I spent one year as visiting student (2014) at [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/).

My current research interests include Algorithmic Game Theory, Cryptography, and Machine Learning.
