Matheus Venturyne Xavier Ferreira is a Postdoctoral Fellow in Computer Science at [Harvard John A. Paulson School Of Engineering And Applied Sciences](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/). He received his B.S. in Computer Engineering (2016) from [Federal University of Itajub√°](https://en.unifei.edu.br/), and Ph.D. (2021) in Computer Science from [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) supervised by [S. Matthew Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/). He was a [Brazil Science without Borders](https://www.iie.org/programs/brazil-scientific-mobility Fellow) (2014) at [UC, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), and a [LATinE Fellow](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/Trailblazers) (2020) at [Purdue University, College of Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr).

His research focuses on designing secure and fair systems by taking into account that, in many instances, real-world adversaries are economically motivated. His research has combined cryptography and game theory insights to guide the design of fair Internet auctions and energy-efficient blockchains.
