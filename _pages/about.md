Matheus Venturyne Xavier Ferreira is a Postdoctoral Fellow in Computer Science at [Harvard John A. Paulson School Of Engineering And Applied Sciences](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/). He holds a Ph.D. (2022) and a M.A. (2018) in Computer Science from [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) and a B.S. in Computer Engineering (2016) from [Federal University of Itajub√°](https://en.unifei.edu.br/). His research focuses on computational economics for decentralized systems and the design of secure systems against economically motivated adversaries. His research combines cryptography and game theory insights to design decentralized markets and better understand the foundations of energy-efficient blockchains and underlaying applications. He has been honored with a [CNS Prize for Excellence in Networking](https://cns.ucsd.edu/cns-students-portal/cns-espresso-prize-for-excellence-in-networking/#:~:text=The%20CNS%20Espresso%20Prize%20for%20Excellence%20in%20Networking%20was%20awarded,class%20CSE%20123%2C%20Computer%20Networks.) from UC, San Diego (2014), a Dean's Grand from [Princeton Graduate School](https://gradschool.princeton.edu/) (2016), a [LATinE Fellowship](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/Trailblazers) (2020) from [Purdue College of Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr), an Award for Excellence from [Princeton School of Engineering](https://engineering.princeton.edu/) (2020).
