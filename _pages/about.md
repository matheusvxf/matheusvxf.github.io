Matheus Venturyne Xavier Ferreira is a Postdoctoral Fellow in Computer Science at [Harvard John A. Paulson School Of Engineering And Applied Sciences](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/). He holds a PhD (2022) and a MA (2018) in Computer Science from [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) and a BS in Computer Engineering (2016) from [Federal University of Itajub√°](https://en.unifei.edu.br/). His research focuses on the computational economics of distributed systems and security against economically motivated adversaries. His research has combined cryptography and game theory insights to design decentralized markets and better understand the foundations of energy-efficient blockchains and underlaying applications. His honors include an [CNS Prize for Excellence in Networking](https://cns.ucsd.edu/cns-students-portal/cns-espresso-prize-for-excellence-in-networking/) from UC, San Diego (2014), a Dean's Grand from [Princeton Graduate School](https://gradschool.princeton.edu/) (2016), a [LATinE Fellowship](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/Trailblazers) (2020) from Purdue College of Engineering, and an [Award for Excellence](https://engineering.princeton.edu/news/2020/12/03/award-excellence-honors-graduate-student-achievement) from Princeton School of Engineering (2020). Matheus is from Itabira, which is known as the Brazilian capital of poetry.
