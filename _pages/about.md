I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student in the [Theory of Computer Science](http://theory.cs.princeton.edu/) group at Princeton. I am fortunate to be advised by [S. Matthew Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/). My primary research interest is Algorithmic Game Theory - that is, algorithm design under strategic environments. My research also intersects with Computer Security, Cryptography, and Machine Learning by combining different techniques to tackle game theoretical problems and vice-versa.

Previously, I did my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at [Federal University of Itajub√°](https://en.unifei.edu.br/) in Brazil and I spent a year as visiting student at [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/).
