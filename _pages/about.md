Matheus Venturyne Xavier Ferreira is a Postdoctoral Fellow in Computer Science at [Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/) and starting in Summer 2024, he will be an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Virginia. He earned his Ph.D. (2022) and MA (2018) in Computer Science from [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) and his BS in Computer Engineering (2016) from the [Federal University of Itajubá](https://en.unifei.edu.br/). His research interests include AI, Algorithmic Economics and Security. He applies artificial intelligence, optimization and theoretical computer science tools to create secure, transparent, and auditable platforms. For instance, he designs auctions that prevent auctioneers from profiting from manipulations. 

He has been recognized with several awards, including the [CNS Prize for Excellence in Networking](https://cns.ucsd.edu/cns-students-portal/cns-espresso-prize-for-excellence-in-networking/) from UC, San Diego (2014), the Dean's Grand from [Princeton Graduate School](https://gradschool.princeton.edu/) (2016-2021), the [LATinE Fellowship](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/Trailblazers) (2020) from Purdue College of Engineering, and the [Award for Excellence](https://engineering.princeton.edu/news/2020/12/03/award-excellence-honors-graduate-student-achievement) from Princeton School of Engineering (2020). Matheus hails from Itabira, the Brazilian capital of poetry.
