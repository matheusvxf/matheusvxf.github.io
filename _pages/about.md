I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student in the [Theory of Computer Science](http://theory.cs.princeton.edu/) group at Princeton. I am fortunate to be advised by [S. Matthew Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/). My primary research interest are in Algorithmic Game Theory, Information Security and Policy. My main goal is to design secure and fair systems under strategic behavior.

Previously, I did my undergraduate studies at [Federal University of Itajub√°](https://en.unifei.edu.br/) in Brazil. I started as Materials Science and Engineering and ended becoming a Computer Engineering due to the great mentorship of Professor [Carlos Henrique da Silveira](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3775476837964989). I also one of my best years (practicing my English and learning more about Computer Science) as an exchange student at [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) under a [BSMP](https://www.iie.org/programs/brazil-scientific-mobility) scholarship. My [CV](/files/vita.pdf).
