Matheus Venturyne Xavier Ferreira is a Postdoctoral Fellow in Computer Science at [Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/). He holds a PhD (2022) and a MA (2018) in Computer Science from [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) and a BS in Computer Engineering (2016) from the [Federal University of Itajubá](https://en.unifei.edu.br/). His primary research interests are in market design, algorithmic economics, cryptography, and information security. He is particularly interested in how one can build trust by building platforms that have the incentive to follow their own specification. For example, auctions are the main building block of how we transact on eBay or how Google sells advertising; however, it is impossible to know whether or not a self-interested auctioneer is also shill bidding, i.e., bidding in their auction with a fake identity. His research shows this kind of manipulation is not inevitable, and one can design auctions that are credible by design.

His honors include a [CNS Prize for Excellence in Networking](https://cns.ucsd.edu/cns-students-portal/cns-espresso-prize-for-excellence-in-networking/) from UC, San Diego (2014), a Dean's Grand from [Princeton Graduate School](https://gradschool.princeton.edu/) (2016-2021), a [LATinE Fellowship](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/Trailblazers) (2020) from Purdue College of Engineering, and an [Award for Excellence](https://engineering.princeton.edu/news/2020/12/03/award-excellence-honors-graduate-student-achievement) from Princeton School of Engineering (2020). Matheus is from Itabira, which is known as the Brazilian capital of poetry.
