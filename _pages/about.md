I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student in the [Theory of Computer Science](http://theory.cs.princeton.edu/) group at Princeton. I am fortunate to be advised by [S. Matthew Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/). My primary research interest are in Algorithms, Game Theory, Mechanism Design, Applied Cryptography, Information Security and Policy. My main research goal is to design secure and fair systems under strategic behavior.

Previously, I did my undergraduate studies at [Federal University of Itajub√°](https://en.unifei.edu.br/) in Brazil. During my Undergraduate, I also spent a great year as an exchange student at [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) under a [BSMP](https://www.iie.org/programs/brazil-scientific-mobility) scholarship.
