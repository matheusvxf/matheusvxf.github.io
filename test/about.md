Computer Security

I am a Computer Science PhD student in the <a href="http://theory.cs.princeton.edu/">Theoretical Computer Science</a> group at Princeton. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/">Matt Weinberg</a>.

Previously, I did my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at Federal University of Itajub√°, Itabira and I spent one year as visiting student at University of California, San Diego.

I am primarily interested in Algorithm Design. My current research interests include Algorithmic Game Theory, Mechanism Design and its applications to Computer Security and Cryptography.
